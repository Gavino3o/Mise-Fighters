# Mise Fighters

**Mise Fighters is a Local Multiplayer Co-op Hack & Slash RPG.**<br>
The game lets you play as a chef, a butcher, a bartender or a pattisier on a mission to withstand the fury of vengeful food ingredients that have mysteriously come to life to seek revenge for their cooked brethren.<br>
While Hack & Slash games often exhibit a gory and intense atmosphere, Mise Fighters is infused with humour and light-heartedness while maintaining a thrilling action-packed gameplay.<br>
