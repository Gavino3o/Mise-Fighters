title: Mise Fighters Game Development Document
---


**Mise Fighters is a Local Multiplayer Co-op Hack & Slash RPG.**<br>
The game lets you play as a chef, a butcher, a bartender or a pattisier on a mission to withstand the fury of vengeful food ingredients that have mysteriously come to life to seek revenge for their cooked brethren.<br>
While Hack & Slash games often exhibit a gory and intense atmosphere, Mise Fighters is infused with humour and light-heartedness while maintaining a thrilling action-packed gameplay.

<br>

## Problem Motivation

Drawing inspiration from beloved hack and slash titles like Hades and Hyper Light Drifter, we set out to create a whimsical online multiplayer cooperative hack and slash experience. Our game introduces a team of a chef, a butcher, a bartender and a pâtissier on a mission to withstand the fury of vengeful food ingredients that have mysteriously come to life. While hack and slash games often exhibit a gory and intense atmosphere, we wanted to infuse our game with humour and light-heartedness while maintaining a thrilling action-packed gameplay.

In our unique culinary adventure, players are not only encouraged but also rewarded for synergizing their skills to unleash mesmerizing combos and amusing effects against the culinary adversaries. By seamlessly combining their culinary prowess, the 4 friends can overcome the challenges and obstacles thrown their way.

## Overview

### Game Flow

In the main menu, players can customise their controls/keybinds before choosing to either host a game or join a game. They can also access a character guide menu to read about the playable characters’ skills.

Upon connecting as a host or a client, both players can choose their characters in a character selection lobby, after which loading into the first stage. There are 3 stages in total, each stage increasing in difficulty and culminating in a boss challenge at the end. Enemies will spawn in waves and target the players, and they have to work together to defeat the horde. Once all waves of enemies are defeated the players can proceed to the next stage.

For combat, every character firstly has a unique auto-attack that fires automatically, their primary method of doing damage to enemies. Each character also has an arsenal of skills/spells that can be cast, each with unique effects and cooldowns. Enemies on the other hand deal damage either by firing projectiles of their own or directly colliding with the player. Further depth is added to combat through a status effect system, where players and enemy units alike can be afflicted with buffs or debuffs, providing additional options for dealing with enemies.

At the end of the final stage, there will be a boss fight with a tanky, hard-hitting enemy that has access to multiple moves and attack patterns. Defeating the boss would result in a victory for the players.

Upon victory or defeat, players will be brought back to the main menu, where they can play again with different characters.

### Units

Units in the game have 4 core stats: Health Points(HP), Attack Power(ATK), Attacks Per Second, and Movement Speed. Both Characters and Enemies are considered units.

They can also be afflicted with status effects. When afflicted by status effects, there will be simple sprite animations so that it is obvious to the player.

| Name | Effect |
|------|--------|
| Taunt | Enemies change targets to the object |
| Slow (CYAN) | Movement speed is by 50% |
| Freeze (BLUE) | Enemies are unable to move |
| Flattened (INVERTED SPRITE) | Movement speed is decreased by 50%, Attack Power is reduced by 50% |
| Douse/Burn (GREY/RED) | Douse: Attack on the unit is increased by 50% <br> Burn: Damage over time debuff is inflicted. If target is doused, an additional 7 Ignition Damage is inflicted |
| Buff (GREEN) | Attack Power is increased by +50% (affects all scaling) |

### Playable Characters

![PlayableCharacters](images/PlayableCharacters.png)

4 characters with varying play styles and multiple cooperative options to deal with enemy waves. (See Appendix A for the detailed rundown on the characters’ stats and movesets)

Each character will have original hand-drawn sprites and animations for their various skills and movement.

### Enemy variety

The game has various enemy types that will spawn in waves. The enemies target the players and use AStar pathfinding algorithms to advance on the players. Different enemies have different attacks and behaviours to provide some strategic depth to how players want to deal with them. (See Appendix B for the detailed rundown on the enemies’ stats, move sets and behaviours)

Enemy waves have different enemy amounts and enemy variety, and are designed to provide a scaling difficulty curve as the game progresses. Enemies are spawned from various spawn points around the arena and will path find towards and attack the characters.

### Environments

The game will have different stages for the players to fend off the horde in. The environment can pose an added challenge to the players by virtue of both restricting the space available to kite enemies around the arena as well as obstacles that can hinder/slow movement.

#### Stages

1. **The Restaurant**
   - In this stage there should not be any stage hazards. This stage is designed to have large area for ease of movement.
   - Some tables and chairs are present to obstruct movement of both players and enemies. It also includes an accessible kitchen and toilet area for players to explore.
2. **Market Area**
   - A colourful market area with various obstacles to obstruct movement or allow for kiting. This stage includes new enemy variants that will keep the players on their toes.
3. **Basement**
   - Final face off against the boss monster, in an arena stage. This stage includes a large open space for players to move around and dodge the bosses attacks.


### User Interface (UI)

The in game overlay will provide key information to the player while also being as unobtrusive as possible.

### Music/SFX

The game will consist of captivating audio throughout. Players are able to enjoy background music in menus and in game accompanied by fun sound effects for characters, enemies and environments. The audio of this game aims to enhance the player experience.

### System Testing/Regression Testing
Throughout the software development process, measures were taken to ensure code changes on the commit would not jeopardise the existing product. Before any commits/after every work session  a simple runthrough of the game was conducted to lookout for new bugs/console errors that might arise.

This was especially important when working on the character/enemy related scripts, as they all had to interact with one another; sometimes improving a system would require changing how these scripts interact.

1. Game starts up and loads the offline scene successfully.
2. One instance hosts and another joins, ready system working as intended and background music is playing for both instances. Character select panel displays the hovered character.
3. In game, both characters’ movement, animations, attacks and sound effects can be seen/heard on each others’ screens. Notably, movement abilities that drastically change the player position still gets networked without error.
4. Players take turns attacking enemies with both skills and auto attacks. Once the enemies die, they despawn properly on both instances. 
5. Upon completing the waves of enemies, no more enemies spawn and the ready screen is displayed.
6. Upon completion of the boss level, the ready screen’s continue button brings both players to an empty scene where a victory popup is displayed. Players can then return to the main menu.

### User Acceptance Testing

Testing procedure: Game was given to the participants without any explanation, testers gameplay was observed and noted down.

Afterwards an interview is conducted with the tester to explain anything unclear about the game and ask for their feedback.

#### SESSION 1: Date: 24/6/2023

**Playtester #1 description:** <br>
Limited experience with this genre of 2D hack and slash
Experience with top down MOBAs

**Playtester #2 description:**<br>
Little/No experience with action games.

**Observations:**<br>

- Hosting and joining was not immediately clear, more explanation probably needed or better naming of buttons.
- Controls were unknown, tutorial screen or controls shown in main menu would have been helpful. We ended up having to break silence and at least tell them the controls, especially for the less experienced playtester.
- Movement was smooth as well as camera follow.
- Desired more feedback on enemy hit/defeat.
- Playtester #2 suggested a “puff of smoke” when enemies were defeated.
- Playtester #1 felt the game was too easy.
- Both playtesters communicated while playing.
- Sometimes one would ask another for help with a swarm of enemies.
- However, no communication about specific skill combinations actually took place. This could come with more experience with the game, but unknown for now.

#### SESSION 2: Date: 22/7/2023

Playtester hosted the lobby and played together with a dev. The dev gave minimal insight regarding HOW to play the characters,  but would still communicate stuff happening in game.
 
**Playtester #3 description:**<br>
Avid watcher of game playthroughs, familiar with many genres of games.
Experience with top down MOBAs.
Experience with co-op games like Overcooked.

**Observations:**<br>

- Felt the game was way too hard
- Game dragged on for a really long time and enemies piled up fast.
- Increased intervals and decreased wave counts for earliest waves.
- Preemptively reduced enemy counts across the board.
- Swarmer enemies being introduced in the first stage is quite jarring for new players.
- Removed all “fast” enemies from the first stage.
- Boss was too easy and dies too quickly, felt the stages were harder than the boss.
- Increased boss health, attack count, attack frequency.
- Lack of healing felt quite unforgiving.
- Changed heal on revive to be 75%.
- Added healing to Butcher’s taunt.

**Patissier clunky to play, difficult to hit enemies**

- Originally meant to be a character with a unique DoT and run play pattern, but not as obvious to the player.
- I think it’s good for some characters to be stronger when learnt.
- Buffed hitboxes of the normal attack at least, as the visuals need to be more forgiving for multiplayer

**Bartender feels strong**

- Good beginner friendly character
- We want the butcher to feel this way as well, so we buffed his invincibility duration on the taunt and his overall tankiness.

We improved the feedback on buffing and status effect application in general, and the playtester actively tried to buff their ally when playing bartender/butcher.
Buffing is direct and obvious enough to be actively considered.
Less direct combos like taunting and AoEs seem to be subconsciously used as well (although this could be a result of playtesters experience with MOBAs)

Appreciated the control mapping.
Felt the unit guide was ‘cute’.

#### SESSION 3: Date: 23/7/2023

**Playtester #4 description:**<br>
Experience with games like Vampire Survivors and Hades, well-versed with this genre of games.

**Playtester #5 description:**<br>
Experience with some FPS games.

**Observations:**<br>
In general playtester #4 was more comfortable with the controls owing to their experience.

Both playtesters made exclamations about gameplay (sufficiently engaged) and would ask for help dealing with enemies (especially the faster ones in stage 2)

- Players were surprised by the tomatoes and swarmers in stage 2
- Good difficulty mixup
- The fast enemies only wave caused a lot of chaos
- Difficulty curve from stage 1 to 2 is evident
- Spaghetti monster is sufficiently tanky; the bullet hell attacks force the players to move around
- Felt it was a bit challenging for melee characters
- Playtester #4 complained about hitboxes a lot, especially when combined with the multiplayer delay.
- Altered hitboxes/hurt boxes for more precise dodging and hitreg.
- Key takeaway is that the player’s spells/attacks should have larger hitboxes than their sprites to give some leeway for multiplayer, and the enemies’ attack hit boxes can be smaller than their sprite suggests to allow for more outplay potential/narrow precise dodging.

Playtester #4 enjoyed the chef the most due to the high damage output and mobility.

Playtester #5 enjoyed the bartender the most due to the ranged attacks.

Character identities seemed sufficiently defined, different playstyles are available to match different player preferences.

**Example questions:**

- Do you have any general thoughts about the game?
- Which character was your favourite?
- Which character was your least favourite?
- Which enemy gave you the most trouble?
- Did you find the game challenging enough?

## Problems Faced

Managing the multiple aspects of the game 
With such a complex design and multiple interconnected parts, there was a constant need for us to update each other on the changes we made and do peer code reviews to understand the design of all the game systems, at least at a basic level.

Us having to affect multiple scripts/systems when making changes also led to the occasional merge conflicts.

Managing the difficulty curve (solved with playtesting)
As developers we are very familiar with the game and its mechanics, so we would naturally underestimate the difficulty of the game. Even with this in mind, we somehow still managed to make the game too difficult on the first playtest. Through player feedback we have brought the difficulty back to an acceptable level, but definitely could be refined more.

### Bugs Squashed:

#### Synchronisation bugs

Faced many challenges involving syncing of values across clients. Especially with so many moving parts, we had to make sure values were synchronised properly.

To fix this bug, we used SyncVar and ServerRPC calls to alter values that are meant to be synced (notably, health) this not only reduced desync but made health bars more responsive and stop jittering, which was a problem before.

#### Client side errors and dealing with RPC calls

Often when implementing features they would work on the host instance/in singleplayer but break in multiplayer on the client instance.

To fix these bugs, we had to correctly implement RPC calls and chain the correct function calls together. For instance, UI displays were bugged and inconsistent for the client instance. Our solution was to chain a TargetRPC function so that only the targeted connection shows the new UI, while other clients remain unaffected (this was useful for Respawn screen and Pause menu screen)

#### Spellcasting related bugs

Spell casting was challenging to implement as animations and damagers had to be synchronised across both clients. We often encountered issues where the client could not cast spells in the desired input direction.

We found out the bug was caused by us calculating/accessing values from our InputCharacter class within RPC functions. To fix it we passed the data as arguments instead.

#### Enemy spawning

Initially, our enemy system uses multiple spawners per wave with set number of enemies per wave and pre-determined enemy variants. The wave system also utilised a buffer mechanism to determine the number of enemy deaths before signalling a wave transition. This system has caused some performance issues and logic error when the wave sized has been increased and boss waves were implemented.

After some brainstorming, we decided we had to overhaul the whole enemy system entirely. The new system would utilise one spawner per wave with set number of enemies, and the enemy variants spawned are determined by set probability. Wave transition conditions were also revised to be more in depth with multiple checks instead of just checking for enemy death counts. These changes have made the wave transition more stable and made enemy waves more diverse and unpredictable, resulting in overall better player experience.
